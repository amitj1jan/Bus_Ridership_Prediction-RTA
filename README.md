Machine Learning &amp; Deep Learning models

This project is to predict daily ridership at given Bus Stop at a given date for a particular route.
Data for this is taken from DubaiPulse -RTA-BusRidership daily data, which is aggregated daily for input.
Many a other external data is used for the purpose like Holiday, weather data and Bus Stations data.
Out of Machine Learning algorithms - XGB and LGB are taken, fine tuned and tested on test data.
Dense layer is used from Deep Learning tensorflow/keras liberaries.

Mean Absolute Error is the metric used for measuring performance of the model and is found to be in the range of 10-14 passangers for different machine/deep learning models.
